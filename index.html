<!-- <p>Software engineer and video game developer with over a decade of experience with Game Maker Studio Pro, as well as some experience in drawing 8-bit sprites and backgrounds.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I began programming at the age of eleven, using the early Game Maker Lite version, creating rudimentary games. As time progressed and I worked harder with the programme, with no professional instruction, I was able to discern enough to create more complex games, as well as draw out the necessary graphics for the games.</p> -->
